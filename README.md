Abstract

This is a small Node utility for converting the layers of a Photoshop

intention is to hand-draw the slides as individual transparent layers in
an application like Procreate on the iPad and convert the layers into
flattened slides for regular presentation via PowerPoint.

Installation
------------

```
$ npm install -g psd2pptx
```

Usage
-----

```shell
$ psd2pptx -v -o sample.pptx sample.psd
```
